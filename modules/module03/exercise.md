1. Write a program that will let you enter in a word or sentence in lower case 
   and will print it out with the first letter capitalized. Hint, all 
   strings have a method **capitalize**, see if you can use it.

2. Write a program that will let you enter a sentence and will print each word
   out on a line. Hint: use the strings **split** function with what you know
   about **for loops** and **lists**.
